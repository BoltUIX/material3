Material 3 is a new design language by Google for the Flutter Material library.

## Getting Started

    * Material 3 is a new design language by Google for the Flutter Material library.
    * We have created a sample Flutter app to showcase Material 3 features.
    * The app allows users to switch between Material 2 and Material 3, light and dark themes, and different color palettes.
    * The app has an Adaptive Layout that adjusts based on screen size.
    * The updated components in the app include AppBar, buttons, FAB, Card, Dialog, NavigationBar, and NavigationRail.
    * The Color Screen generates a full color scheme from a single seed color and displays all the colors in light and dark palettes.
    * The Typography Screen shows the text styles used in the default TextTheme.
    * The Elevation Screen demonstrates the new supported feature "surfaceTintColor" in the Material library.
    * The Flutter app is an excellent way to discover the latest features in Material 3.
    * You can download the demo and check out the guidance at https://m3.material.io/ to learn more about Material 3.
